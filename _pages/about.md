Hi, I'm Aujas Jain, a Year 2 IBDP student with a deep passion for Mathematics and Computer Science. I love making small personal projects using Arduino and Python, and I'm always down to learn something new.

I hold the position of TOK Head in my school's student council and am also the head of the CS Club.

In my free time, youâ€™ll usually find me with a guitar in hand, playing both classical and electric pieces or composing my own songs. If not, then I am surely on my Playstation, replaying Bloodborne and Hollow Knight for the hundredth time or downloading something new that catches my eye.

Currently, I study at Elpro International School, with my main subjects being Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.
